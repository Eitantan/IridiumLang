# Iridium Programming Language
Iridium is a Object-Oriented Programming Language Designed to be Simple and Powerful.

## Whats special about Iridium?
- It's fast.
- It's powerful
- It's free
- It's perfect for beginners and pros alike!
- It's open-source under the GNU General Public License v3.0
- Its written in C# (there's also a NodeJS version, which has more syntax.)
- Syntax for getting internal variables

# Syntax (unfinished)

## Startup
Make sure you have Iridium installed or NodeJS, and then, when it prompts you to do a command:
```>>> ```
Type in:
```shell
>>> iri -c path/to/file.iri
```
You can use literally any extension, but `.iri` is usually used as not to interrupt the compilers/interpreters of other languages.


## ~~Enviroment Variables~~
~~advanced-mode = true. //sets advanced syntax to true. Includes Linux command support and C-Like syntax~~
~~graphics-mode = true. //sets the graphics_EngineOn internal variable to true~~
```web_mode = true. // make a web with Iridium```
~~shell = true. // sets a shell loop after every program runs.~~

## Output:
```
Console.out('Hello").
// Can use any combination of quotes. :D
```

## Declaring Variables
```
var sample = "Strings are the first data types supported.".
var boolean_supported = true.
var this_is_true = ButBooleanAreSupportedToo.
var age = 13.4. // and numbers!
```

## Printing Variables
```
print = $sample
```

## Classes And Objects
```
class hello{
  // Stuff
}

hello = new hello.

class hello:hewwo{
//Class inheritance
}
```


## Methods
```
static method_name(arg1,arg2){
	// DO cool stuff
}
```

## Decisions & Accepting user input
```
Console.In().
```
## Math
```
a = 2 + 2.
math.sqrt(5).

a = pow(4(3)).

a = avrg({dataset}).

a = factorial(5).

a = sin(5).

a = log(5, base=2.71828182845905).

a = MAD({dataset}{dataset}).

a = percent(5.1).

a = Decimal(5).

a = 
```
## Data Structures
```
// array 
array = new array[](
array[0] = "hi".
).
example = array[1].

//dictionary

hey = new Dictionary([5])(
add[0] "hey".
).
example = hey[1]

//list 
list = new list(
add to list "wut".
).
example = list[1]

//dataset WARNING: ONLY USE FOR NUMBERS
average = new dataset[](
add 5 to average.
).
example = average[1].
```
